    <h1>Privacy Policy for Explorare</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 22, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Explorare ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>A. Location Data</h3>
    <p>Our Service uses your device's precise location (Latitude and Longitude) to provide its core functionality: finding and recommending nearby restaurants. We only access this data when the app is in use and you have granted us permission.</p>

    <h3>B. Device and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>When you access the Service, we may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and model.</li>
        <li>Operating system version.</li>
        <li>Unique device identifiers (such as the IDFA, subject to your consent).</li>
        <li>Interaction data (e.g., ad impressions and clicks).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Search Queries and Preferences</h3>
    <p>We collect the search terms (e.g., cuisine types) and preferences (e.g., "Favorites") you input to filter and personalize restaurant recommendations.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To locate and display restaurants near you using third-party mapping and venue services.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To tailor restaurant recommendations based on your location and preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To display relevant advertisements through Google AdMob.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To monitor usage limits (e.g., daily swipe limits) locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Transactions:</strong> To process subscriptions and in-app purchases via Apple's StoreKit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We may share your information with the following third-party service providers to facilitate our Service:</p>

    <h3>A. Foursquare</h3>
    <p>We send your precise location and search queries to Foursquare to retrieve restaurant details, photos, and ratings.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Foursquare Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Google Maps Platform</h3>
    <p>We may use Google Maps services to provide map data and location information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements. If you allow tracking via the iOS App Tracking Transparency prompt, Google may use your device identifier (IDFA) to serve personalized ads.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob Privacy & Terms</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Apple StoreKit</h3>
    <p>All financial transactions for the "Pro" subscription are handled directly by Apple. We do not process or store your credit card information.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Most of your user data, including "Favorites," "Last Visited" history, and daily usage counters, is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms (UserDefaults). This data is not uploaded to our own servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Caching:</strong> To improve performance, we temporarily cache restaurant data locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Services:</strong> You can enable or disable location services for Explorare at any time via your device settings. Note that disabling location will prevent the app from finding nearby restaurants.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Tracking:</strong> You can decline app tracking when prompted or manage your preference in iOS Settings > Privacy > Tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Since most data is stored locally, deleting the app will remove your preferences, favorites, and history from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
