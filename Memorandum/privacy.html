Privacy Policy for Codename Clefairy
  Last Updated: December 23, 2025

  This Privacy Policy describes how Codename Clefairy ("we," "us," or "our")
  handles data in our iOS application. We are committed to protecting your
  privacy and being transparent about the minimal data processed by our app.

  1. Data Collection and Usage
  Our application is designed to prioritize user privacy. We do not require a
  user account, and we do not collect personal identifiers such as your name,
  email address, phone number, or physical location.

   * Game Progress (Local Data): We store your high scores and game
     preferences locally on your device using standard Apple storage
     (UserDefaults). This data remains on your device and is not transmitted
     to our servers.
   * Thematic Customization: The application uses your device's local system
     clock to provide seasonal emoji themes (e.g., holiday-themed graphics).
     This calculation happens entirely on-device.

  2. Third-Party Services
  To support the development and maintenance of this application, we use
  third-party service providers who may collect data according to their own
  privacy policies.

   * Google AdMob: Our app integrates the Google Mobile Ads SDK to display
     advertisements. AdMob may collect and use information such as:
       * Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, where permitted).
       * IP addresses (for general location estimation and fraud prevention).
       * Interactions with advertisements (clicks and views).
       * Diagnostic information for SDK performance.

  For more information, please visit Google’s Privacy & Terms
  (https://policies.google.com/privacy).

  3. Device Permissions
  The application requires the following minimal permissions:
   * Network Access: Required to fetch and display advertisements via Google
     AdMob.

  The app does not request access to your Camera, Microphone, Contacts, or
  Precise Location (GPS).

  4. Children’s Privacy
  Codename Clefairy is a family-friendly game. We do not knowingly collect
  personal information from children. Our advertising partners may serve
  non-personalized ads in compliance with applicable laws like COPPA
  (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) depending on the configuration of
  the AdMob network.

  5. Your Rights and Choices
   * Opting Out of Tracking: You can limit ad tracking or reset your
     advertising identifier through your iOS device settings (Settings >
     Privacy & Security > Tracking).
   * Data Deletion: Since we do not store your data on our servers, you can
     "delete" all game-related data simply by uninstalling the application
     from your device.

  6. Changes to This Policy
  We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
  any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the
  "Last Updated" date.

  7. Contact Us
  If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not
  hesitate to contact our development team.

  Developer/Legal Analysis Note:
   * Tracking Compliance: The current codebase initializes MobileAds but does
     not currently implement the AppTrackingTransparency (ATT) framework
     prompt. To comply with Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines (Guideline
     5.1.2), if you intend to use the IDFA for personalized tracking, an ATT
     implementation would be required in a future update.
   * Data Minimization: The app adheres strictly to data minimization
     principles, as no personal data is exfiltrated to first-party servers.
